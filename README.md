# AirBnB_clone

## Concept

* A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging)

* A website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic

* A database or files that store data (data = objects)

* An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them)

## First step: Write a command interpreter to manage your AirBnB objects. This is the first step towards building your first full web application: the AirBnB clone.

***This first step is very important because you will use what you build during this project with all other following projects.***

* Implement the parent class called "BaseModel"

* Create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file

* Create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Placeâ€¦) that inherit from BaseModel

* Create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.

* Create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine
